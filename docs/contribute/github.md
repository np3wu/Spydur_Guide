# Access to GitHub
{: .fs-9 }

This website is hosted on GitHub along with all the files that make it up in a repository [here](https://github.com/np3wu/Spydur_Guide).

First, you will need to create a GitHub account. You can do this by going to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign up using an email address.

Once you have an account, you can access the repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/np3wu/Spydur_Guide).

## Requesting access as a collaborator
{: .fs-9 }

To be able to make any changes onto the repository, you will need to be added as a collaborator. Any current collaborator can add you to the repository.

To add a collaborator, go to the repository and click on the `Settings` tab. Then click on `Manage access` on the left side of the screen. You can then click on the `Invite a collaborator` button and type in the username of the person you want to add.

## A bit about how GitHub works
{: .fs-9 }

Feel free to skip this section if you just want to know how to add stuff to the website. But knowing a little bit about how GitHub works will help you understand the process better, and maybe even help you troubleshoot if something goes wrong.

I think of GitHub like a cloud storage service, but with a twist. You can store files on GitHub, but you can also keep track of changes made to those files. This is done through a process called version control.

Version control is similar to Marvel's Cinematic Universe (MCU) timeline. I'll try to explain some terminology using the MCU as an example.
> - **Repository**: In Marvel's multiverse, each universe represents a separate reality, like Earth-616, Earth-199999 (Marvel Cinematic Universe), etc. Similarly, in Git, each repository is like a universe where a project's codebase exists.
> - **Branch**: In the MCU, each timeline represents a different branch of reality. For example, the main timeline is the main branch, and the branch where Loki escapes with the Tesseract is a different branch. Similarly, in Git, a branch is a parallel version of the repository. It is used to work on a feature or bug fix without affecting the main branch.
> - **Commit**: In the MCU, each event is a commit. For example, the snap is a commit. Similarly, in Git, a commit is a snapshot of the repository at a specific point in time.
> - **Pull Request**: In the MCU, a pull request is like a timeline where the Avengers go back in time to get the stones. They made the change by stealing the stones and then commit on the original timeline. Similarly, in Git, a pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another.
> - **Push and Pull**: In Git, pushing and pulling changes allow developers to move between their local repository and the remote repository. It's akin to traveling between different dimensions or realities, bringing changes from one universe (local repository) to another (remote repository), or vice versa.

If you're still feeling a bit confused, don't worry! You'll get the hang of it as you start using GitHub more. Here's a [video on how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE)
