# Want to help out? Here's how!
{: .fs-9 }

When I started out making this website, I wanted to create a place where information can be easily passed down from one generation of students to the next. I also wanted to create a place where students can learn from each other and share their knowledge!

This website is good as is but any additional contribution will be greatly appreciated! Every page on this website is written in markdown and can be easily edited. This section will show you how to write and upload new content to the website.
