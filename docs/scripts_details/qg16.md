```python
def create_slurm_file(jobname):
    slurm_template = """#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --account=####  ## your username
#SBATCH --mail-user=####   ## your email address
```

The `####` in the above lines should be replaced with your username and email address respectively.

You can also edit any other `#SBATCH` specification to suit your needs.
