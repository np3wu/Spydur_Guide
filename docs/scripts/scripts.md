# Downloading Necessary Scripts
{: .fs-9 }

Here you can follow the directions to download the necessary scripts to improve your workflow on the SPYDUR cluster.

## Where to find the scripts?

All The scripts are neatly organized on the [Spydur Guide] GitHub page located in the `scripts` folder. However, you might realise upon landing on a webpage that there is no direct way to download said folder. To do this, you will have to copy the link of the folder
```
https://github.com/np3wu/Spydur_Guide/tree/main/scripts
```
and then use this [online tool](https://download-directory.github.io/) to directly download the folder.

You should now have a zipped folder containing the scripts. Please unzip the contents into another folder name "scripts" for ease of use.

Next step is to transfer these scripts onto your account on the SPYDUR cluster.
