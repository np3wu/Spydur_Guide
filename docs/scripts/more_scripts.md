# More About Scripts
{: .fs-9 }

Some of these scripts can be run using default Python. But some require outside libraries to be installed. To make sure that all the scripts work, you will need to activate the Python environment that has all the necessary libraries installed. To do this, you will need to run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cd scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To get a better understanding about how these scripts work, I have a section dedicated to what the scripts do, how to use it, and how you can modify it to suit your needs.

But for now. I hope this section has helped you understand how to get scripts onto your account on the SPYDUR cluster and how to use them.
