# Moving Scripts to SPYDUR
{: .fs-9 }

Now that you have downloaded the scripts, you will need to move them to your account on the SPYDUR cluster. To do this, you will need to use a program called WinSCP. WinSCP is a free SFTP, SCP, Amazon S3, WebDAV, and FTP client for Windows. It is a very useful tool that allows you to transfer files between your local computer and a server on the internet.

## Access your account on SPYDUR

If you have not already done so, please refer back to the [Accessing the Spydur Cluster] page to learn how to access your account on the SPYDUR cluster.

## Using WinSCP

Moving files with WinSCP is incredibly intuitive. Once you have opened the program, you will see two panels. The left panel is your local computer, and the right panel is the remote server. You can drag and drop files between the two panels to transfer them.
