# Downloading Necessary Scripts
{: .fs-9 }

Here you can follow the directions to download the necessary scripts to improve your workflow on the SPYDUR cluster.

## Where to find the scripts?

All The scripts are neatly organized on the [Gausstools repository] located in the `scripts` folder. However, you might realise upon landing on a webpage that there is no direct way to download said folder. To do this, you will have to copy the link of the folder
```
https://github.com/np3wu/Gausstools/tree/main/scripts
```
and then use this online tool (https://download-directory.github.io/) to directly download the folder.

Next step is to transfer these scripts onto your account on the SPYDUR cluster.
