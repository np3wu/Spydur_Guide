# **SUMMER RESEARCH GUIDE 2024**
{: .fs-9 }

## **Welcome to Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Research in the Donald Lab.**

I am pleased to be able to host you in the laboratory this summer. I have invited you to join us for research this summer because I am convinced that you will be able to contribute to pushing our research effort forward. This will call on your discipline, intelligence, motivation, and commitment. The experience will provide significant learning opportunities, too. So please take the initiative as the summer progresses to read as much you can about topics related to your project, both from the books available in the laboratory and academic journal articles that are available electronically. As your reading progresses, please feel completely free to ask me or senior students in the group any question you might have.

**Summer Research**: The research job runs for the agreed period of weeks as previously arranged. The research day is from **9:00 am to 5:00 pm**. In addition to making serious and systematic progress on your research project, the intellectual activities will include a weekly research group meeting. During each of these meetings I will give brief talks on concepts relevant to our research work, and you and other students will give oral presentations on research papers and academic topic on a rotating schedule. Other special academic assignments may be given as well during the research period. We may also have a few specially arranged meetings with the Parish group. At the end of summer research, the plan is to head to the MERCURY meeting which will be held at this year at Furman University or an alternative location as we will specify during the first week of research (University of California at Merced, Merced, CA).

A number of social activities are on the agenda, too. We start the summer off with a group dinner, usually with the Parish research group, play cricket once or twice on the weekend. We will have at least one weekly group lunch the department hosts a barbecue in the middle of the research period. Several other activities will come up from time to time as well.

> **The following laboratory guidelines apply.**

(1) **IMPORTANTLY:** the laboratory is for **_research purposes only_**, and is reserved for **_research students only_**. You are definitely free to relax in the lab, but if you wish to meet with groups of friends you must do so elsewhere.

(3) **_The laboratory is not a computer or a reading room for non-group members_**. It has been mistaken for this in the past. If you see others in the laboratory who are not visiting a group member please let them know that the space if for authorized personnel only.

(4) **_Please be considerate_** in your use of the shared space, and the volume of any audio device you may use, etc.

(5) **_Please do not assign any desk or work space_** to non-group members, unless you ask me or the group member who sits at that spot for temporary permission to do so. In general, please host visitors at your work space.

(7) **_In general, please work within the spirit of these requirements_**. Be respectful to your group mates, work quietly, and treat the laboratory as what it is – a research space reserved for our work.

(8) **The bottom line**: Whatever you do, everyone else should be able to do too, without disturbing you.

(9) **Laboratory equipment** (computer peripherals or books etc.) should not be removed from the laboratory without permission.

(10) **Please let me know** if there is anything I can do to make the laboratory a better space for you to work and study. Hopefully these guidelines will help us to be the best stewards we can be of the space, and make life as comfortable for everybody as possible.

## **Good Research Practice**

(1) **Prepare and share protocols:** Whenever you learn something new, such as solving a real input problem with Gaussian or finding a new way to let XWindows work to show Gaussview on Windows machines, please write out a protocol for the task and put a copy in the **“black folder”.** If you do not know where the folder is, please ask the designated laboratory manager.

(2) **If you have problems** with a calculation, please proceed as follows (i) assume that you did something wrong and **re-check it at least three times**, then:

**(ii) Ask two other senior students** in the laboratory to check it for you.

**(iii) Let me know**; but only after (i) and (ii). If I cannot solve it, it probably cannot be solved ☺.

(3) **Keep monitoring your calculations**, do not submit a job and assume that it is still running until you need to check it. Keep following the action, either by checking in regularly or by using “tail –f \[…\].log”.

(4) **Whenever you write something** - a report or poster or draft of paper pass it by a fellow student who will read it carefully and give you serious feedback.

(5) **Always log out of your machine** at the end of the day – otherwise I or Dr. Kanters might have to restart it if I need to check something.

(6) **Any program version you start out with** for a research project MUST be the one you finish with if the data are going to be presented together. Otherwise, you MUST let me know as soon as you switch program versions. E.g. Gaussian 03 (g03) and g09 data must not be combined in the same data set.

(7) While you are working on a project, you must be sure to **Check the Literature** by search for papers with Sci-Finder or Google Scholar etc.. Scifinder:

(8) However, **DO NOT simply TRUST THE DATA**. **Double Check** to make sure you did things correctly. _Error in_, means _misleading results out_. To keep from being _mis_led, always double check what you put in.

(9) Of course, normal ethical principles apply, report data fully, clearly and honestly, whether it supports your hypothesis or not. **Let the data guide you**, do not guide the data. The data knows where the Nobel Prizes are, you do not.

(10) **Take care of your equipment**, do not abuse or misuse them. Let me know if problems arise.

## **Presentations**

#### **Topic Presentations**

Select a topic from the summer list provided – _or one of your own with approval from me_ – and put together a solid **20 - 30 minute** oral presentation on the topic (with or without PowerPoint or other presentation programs). Each student will present at least once during the summer. I will ask you (through **the laboratory planner**) to organize the order of the presentations among yourselves.

#### **Paper Presentations**

Please select a paper from a **most recent volume** of a Physical or Computational chemistry journal and put together a solid **20 – 30 minute** presentation on the paper. Each student will present at least once during the summer. I will ask you (through **the laboratory planner**) to organize the order among yourselves.

#### **Research Presentations**

This is a chance for you to tell us in detail and as clearly as possible what you have been doing so far this summer. You should include comments on what the goal of the project is, what you have done so far, and what you plan to do. We will have very detailed questions for you about your work.

#### **Presentation Skills**

Useful guides for presentation skills are available on the web. One that I found is at:

<http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/txie/publications/oral_presentation_skills.pdf>

I’m not recommending it, but let me know what you think if you get a chance to check it out. Additional Resources are also in our lab’s Black Book.

#### **Summer Research Social Activities**

Possible Activities include

(1) **Start of Summer** **Group Dinner** (traditionally with Parish Group) at a Jamaican restaurant nearby.

(2) **Weekly group lunches**, usually at the Tyler Haynes Commons on Tuesdays.

(3) **Cricket** for Computational Chemists, we do this sometimes, if the cricket playing students on campus are up for it, and its usually lots of fun, and no experience is needed.

(4) **Last Day Breakfast/Lunch and Activity.** We try to find some kind of group activity to do that is of strong interest for everyone in the group. Probably a few home games or some other good group activity.

Pictures: During all of these group activities, please share any pictures that you take by uploading them into the group photos folder on box.

**NOTE**: This is a working document, adjustments to plan/guides be made as necessary as we progress.

## **General Guidelines**

#### **Objectives and Expectations.** 
The primary goal of this summer research experience is for you, the beginning research student, to develop a proficiency in the study of chemistry by investigating as yet unexplored topics and to learn how to produce good scientific results in the process. Emphasis is placed on the development of your independent scientific thought and practice in experimental design, laboratory work, use of the chemical literature, and in professional writing and speaking. You will be practicing chemistry as it is practiced in the “real world.” Most of your previous experience in chemistry has come in formal course or laboratory work. This experience will be like that of a graduate research student. So, you should be prepared to use your initiative and assume a significant degree of responsibility for advancing your learning in the process.

Chemistry research is labor intensive. You should plan on spending, at the very least, 40 hours per week working on and thinking about your individual project. Research is a mix of doing, reading and thinking. During the summer, you are expected to work in the laboratory, not remotely, except by agreement after discussion. If you elect to spend some time reading/thinking outside, in the library, over coffee at 8:15, etc., however, be sure to leave a note on your desk so that we can find you should we need to. Ideally, your project is something in which you will take extreme pride and personal interest. You should strive to learn as much as you can about and excel in communicating the details of the research project that you have undertaken. Be aware that chemistry research can often be extremely frustrating, but also extremely rewarding. Sometimes the rewards come only after many disappointments, so don’t give up!

The project you work on is at the forefront of a specific research area, and as such, has the potential to lead to a presentation at a professional meeting or perhaps a publication in a scientific journal. These achievements could be large feathers in your intellectual cap, and I strongly encourage you to go after them. However, you will have to work hard if you want to attain these goals, and you must undertake these endeavors of your own volition. I will be here mainly to guide and encourage you, to cheer you on and keep your spirits up, and to evaluate and recommend you to whomever you choose. In the long run, your hard work here will pay off in many ways that may not be totally obvious to you right now.

#### **The Big Picture.** 
The research project that you will be working on has not been designed for classroom or laboratory simulation purposes. It is an authentic project that aims to find answers to real world problems. The research that you will do has largely never been done before, so keep in mind that you will be working at the cutting edge of international scientific progress in this specific area, and will be paving the way for other scientists to follow!

To effectively collaborate (or compete) with other researchers in this field, most of whom are in larger labs, we have to rely more on our ingenuity and drive to produce something of value. A massive part of this undertaking must be borne by you, my students, since you are the nuts and bolts of this operation and are really the ones who will benefit the most from your experiences. Good results will also allow us to present our work credibly and creditably at regional and national meetings. Finally, simply learning how to produce good results will aid you immensely in your future work, whatever it will be.

## **Specific Requirements.**

#### **The Literature**: 
Keep a running list and an organized file of all references and readings you acquire during all phases of your research. Develop a set of keywords appropriate for your project and perform a SciFinder literature search for your project weekly. For example, if your project involves conformational searching, pay special attention to articles dealing with keywords such as “conformational analysis” and “molecular flexibility” (either modeling, NMR, crystallography, etc.) Peruse the on-line table of contents of at least the following journals weekly for papers that relate to your project: Journal of the American Chemical Society, Angewandte Chemie (International Edition), Chemistry – A European Journal, Journal of Physical Chemistry, Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, Journal of Computational Chemistry, Journal of Molecular Modeling, Journal of Inorganic Chemistry, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. If you find an article related to our work, be sure to obtain an electronic copy for your records. Keep copies of the articles handy so that you may refer to them easily while working and writing, and feel free to share copies of papers with others in the group if you feel that it overlaps with any project on which they are working

#### **Group Meetings**. 
Our initial group meeting will cover some administrative issues and basic techniques. Later meetings will consist of group discussions of your research, the literature and selected special topics. I plan to spend some time in the lab each day, and also in my office (_and in the Dean’s office_), writing papers on recent work for submission to journals. I will be unavailable, therefore, for general discussions at certain points, and will discuss how best to work around that for meetings and problem solving

#### **Presentations**. 
As you prepare your oral presentations or poster for MERCURY later on in the summer, please ask at least one senior person from the lab to review it before sharing it with me and the rest of the group. In general, feel free to add you own individual flair to your presentation to make your efforts stand out, but without compromising the quality of the scientific content. For serious scientific success, the substance must be more important that the show. After giving a presentation, please upload a copy of your presentation in the group box folder.

#### **Written Work**. 
Please submit, each week, a ONE-page summary of your work and your timeline/plans for the coming week first thing every Monday morning. If you need guidance or assistance preparing this report be sure to let me know as soon as possible

#### **The Lab**: 
The phone in the main lab is for your use for campus and for local calls. The number is 1733. If someone needs to reach the lab from outside the University they can call 289-1733.

Please make sure not to eat or drink in a way that will get food or drinks on computers or keyboards and make sure to immediately clean up any spills in the laboratory. Never shutdown the workstations, but be sure to logoff your account when you leave. Computers in the laboratory are restricted for group use. Non-group members should be directed to the computational resource room down the hall. Also, please do not leave the laboratory door unlocked if no one is around.

#### **Data Organization**: 
For insights into the use of Excel please visit one of the many web resources on using Excel. One structured option is the following: <https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-use-excel-tips>.

## **Research Notebooks**
**This is very important!!!** Since the composition of our research group will change frequently, several other researchers will review your notes and attempt to repeat your work. Also, any final reports or presentations you make will be based on the efforts you have recorded in your notebooks. Thus, keeping good notes is imperative! Settle upon a consistent, descriptive, and efficient style and see me for guidance as necessary. It is critically important for you to keep excellent records of your work! Also note that all research notebooks belong to the lab. They should never leave the building. Please make sure to number each page and include a table of contents. You will routinely use the techniques of computational chemistry. Make sure to clearly identify in detail which technique you are using in your laboratory notebook.

> Special Remarks on Laboratory Notebook:** Everything should be legibly written in the research notebook so that those who follow you can reconstruct what you did and what your results were.

A standard “Laboratory Notebook,” in computational and theoretical chemistry is one that contains handwritten notes, computer printouts and graphical images collected together. Each page must be numbered consecutively. The format of the notebook is as follows:

1. Label the notebook on the spine with your name and volume number (use Roman numerals, I, II etc.). Put your personal information (UR address, home address, telephone number(s), e-mail address(es)).
2. Leave at least three pages blank for a “**Table of Contents**.”
3. Start each new theoretical experiment on a blank page. The format for the write up is as follows:
    1. **Title** and **Date** of the experiment
    2. Statement of the **objective** of the experiment.
    3. Computational details that include the method you are using, any applicable literature references, drawing(s) of the molecule with atom numbering, jobname, pathname, machine name and a printout of the command file that you used to perform the calculation.
    4. Results.
4. All should be entered in the notebook at the appropriate place.
5. There will be occasions when you start a new experiment, but on the same day you obtain data for a project obtained earlier. You may either report the data on the page of the earlier experiment; however, the date that the data was obtained must be clearly specified. Alternatively, you may report the data on a new, later page; however, you must refer to the page of the earlier experiment in which the data was obtained. In other words, any reported data for a project must have a clear reference to the “source” of the project.

> Other things that you can include in your laboratory note book include:

- Notes on literature reading (methods, molecules, background, etc)

- Notes on web searching

- Notes on computer information

- Notes on lectures/conversations

- Your thoughts about the project

- Directions to take

- Things that didn’t work, etc

- Keep track of jobs run including the exact location of the command and output files. i.e. machine, pathname

Don’t be afraid to write in your notebook. You’ll summarize the important stuff periodically, but use your research notebook to help you with your time management:

>For instance a typical research notebook entry might look like:
>
>Monday 11-2:30 skimmed JACS volume 120 – no articles pertinent to project
>
>Reviewed unix commands – practiced using them – am becoming quite comfortable

Please provide me an update of your project each Monday along with a brief statement (no more than one page) of the accomplishments and salient results, and a short statement of the next week’s objectives.

Be well,

\- KD
