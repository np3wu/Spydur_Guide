# Building a Molecule Using Chemcraft
{: .fs-9 }

In this section, we will be using Chemcraft to build a molecule. Again ignore the instructions in example 2.1, because we will be using Chemcraft instead of Gauusview.

Open the Chemcraft program (either by clicking on <img alt="chemcraft.png" src="https://github.com/np3wu/Spydur_Guide/blob/main/images/icons/chemcraft.png?raw=true" alt="chemcraft_logo"> or using the search bar). 

Once Chemcraft is open, you will be greeted with a blank screen.
