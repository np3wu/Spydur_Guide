# Example 2.7: Cleaning vs. Optimizing Aniline
{: .fs-9 }

## Objectives
- Compare the energy of aniline in its `cleaned` vs. `optimized` structure.

- Collect number of `imaginary frequencies` and `C-C-N-H` dihedral angle data.

## Prelab Questions

1. What compounds are calculated in this example? What are their `charges` and `spin multiplicities`?

2. This example uses the `Opt` and `Freq` keywords. What do these keywords do in Gaussian calculations? See [Optimization](https://gaussian.com/opt/) and [Frequency](https://gaussian.com/freq/)
