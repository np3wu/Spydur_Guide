# Example 2.4: Comparing Canonical & Biorthogonalized Orbitals
{: .fs-9 }

## Objectives
- Calculate higher spin state systems
- Compare canonical and biorthogonalized orbitals

## Prelab Questions

1. What is the Charge and Multiplicity of FeO^+^?

2. We are going to use a new keyword in the method section `pop=(biorthogonalize,savebiorth)`. Search for the keyword in the [Gaussian Website](https://gaussian.com/population/) and explain what it does.

3. What are alpha and beta electrons? Explain this in the context of the spin state.
