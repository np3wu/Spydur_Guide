# Example 2.3: 1,2-Dichloro-1,2-difluoroethane Conformer Energies
{: .fs-9 }

## Objectives
- Compare the energy of different conformers
- Edit existing geometry using Chemcraft or GaussView
- Use Excel to collect data

## Prelab Questions

1. What compounds are calculated in this example? What are their `charges` and `spin multiplicities`?

2. What physical properties are collected at the end of the calculation?

3. What do you expect the dipole moment of the three conformers?
