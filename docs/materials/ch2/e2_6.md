# Example 2.6: Formaldehyde Optimization & Frequency Calculation
{: .fs-9 }

## Objectives
- Perform a Optimization and Frequency calculation on formaldehyde using the APFD/6-311G+(2d,p) method and basis sets.

- Collect Thermochemistry data.

## Prelab Questions

1. In the `Thermochemistry` section of the output file, There are several values reported: `Zero-point correction`, `Thermal correction to Energy`, `Thermal correction to Enthalpy`, and `Thermal correction to Gibbs Free Energy`.

Check out this explanation of each value [here](https://www.cup.uni-muenchen.de/ch/compchem/vib/thermo1.html).

Compare the difference between the different energy values.

2. Search the Gaussian Website for [Frequency](https://gaussian.com/freq/) and [Optimization](https://gaussian.com/opt/) for examples.

## Key Points

1. Understanding the different values in the `Thermochemistry` section of the output file.

2. Procedure for performing an Optimization and Frequency calculation.
