# Example 2.1: Formaldehyde Energy, Molecular Orbitals and Atomic Charges
{: .fs-9 }

## Objectives
- To calculate the energy of formaldehyde using the APFD/6-311G+(2d,p) method and basis sets.
- Build a molecule using Chemcraft or GaussView and retrieve geometric information.
- Learn how to send a job to the cluster.


## Prelab Questions

1. What is a Gaussian input file? What are the components of a Gaussian input file? Explain each line of input and what function it serves.
> Details on page 44-45 of the book.

2. Write an example input file for formaldehyde.
> Details on page 44-45 of the book.

3. What physical properties are collected at the end of the calculation?
> i.e: SCF energy, dipole moment, etc.
