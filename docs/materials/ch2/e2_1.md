# Example 2.1: Formaldehyde Energy, Molecular Orbitals and Atomic Charges
{: .fs-9 }

## Objectives
- To calculate the energy of formaldehyde using the APFD/6-311G+(2d,p) method and basis sets.
- Build a molecule using Chemcraft or GaussView and retrieve geometric information.
- Learn how to send a job to the cluster.


## Prelab Questions

1. What is a Gaussian input file? What are the components of a Gaussian input file? Explain each line of input and what function it serves.
> Details on page 44-45 of the book.

2. Write an example input file for formaldehyde.
> Details on page 44-45 of the book.

3. What physical properties are collected at the end of the calculation?
> i.e: SCF energy, dipole moment, etc.

## Key Points

1. Use Chemcraft `ctrl + f` to bring up fragment menu.

2. Learn the basic structure of a Gaussian input file.

3. Navigate the terminal using `cd` and `ls` commands. Create folders with `mkdir` and remove them with `rm -r`. Write and edit files with `nano`.

4. Use `qg16` to submit a job to the cluster.

5. Written lab procedure and results.
