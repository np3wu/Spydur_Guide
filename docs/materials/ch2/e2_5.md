# Example 2.5: Spin Polarization in Heterosubstituted Ethene Radicals
{: .fs-9 }

## Objectives
- Visualize Molecular Orbitals using Chemcraft or GaussView to show `atomic spin density`.

- Collect `Mulliken charges` and `spin density` data using Excel.

## Prelab Questions

1. What compounds are calculated in this example? What are their `charges` and `spin multiplicities`?
