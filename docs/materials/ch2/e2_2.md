# Example 2.2: Comparing Formaldehyde and Acetone
{: .fs-9 }

## Objectives
- To calculate the energy of acetone using the APFD/6-311G+(2d,p) method and basis sets.
- Compare the energy of acetone to formaldehyde.

## Prelab Questions

1. What compounds are calculated in this example? What are their `charges` and `spin multiplicities`?

2. What physical properties are collected at the end of the calculation?

3. What do you expect the energy difference between acetone and formaldehyde to be? Why?

## Key Points

1. Collect results from the `.log` file.

2. Practice sending jobs from the procedure.
