# Example 2.8: Acetaldehyde/Oxirane Isomerization Energy
{: .fs-9 }

## Objectives
- Calculate the energy of acetaldehyde and oxirane using the APFD/6-311G+(2d,p) method and basis sets.

- Calculate Isomerization Energy at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) using the formula

```
Isomerization Energy = Thermal Energy(oxirane) - Thermal Energy(acetaldehyde)
```

## Prelab Questions

1. What compounds are calculated in this example? What are their `charges` and `spin multiplicities`?
