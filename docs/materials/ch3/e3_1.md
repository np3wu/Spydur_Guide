# Example 3.1: Optimizing Decamethyldizincocene
{: .fs-9 }

## Objectives

- Build 3 different structures of decamethylzincocene:
    - An n1n5 structure with Cs symmetry
    - An n5n5 structure with D5d symmetry
    - An n5n5 structure with D5h symmetry

- Use `fragments` tab in Chemcraft to build molecules quickly.

- Monitor the optimization as it progresses using Chemcraft.

## Prelab Questions

1. This example uses the new input `Opt=CalcFC` in the Gaussian input file. What does this command do?
