# Example 3.3: Locating a Transition State with QST2
{: .fs-9 }

## Objectives
- Perform a QST2 calculation in Gaussian and identify a transition state.

## Procedure
- Create a structure in Chemcraft of SiH2 and H2
- Create a different structure in Chemcraft of SiH4
- Send an `opt`, `freq` calculation for each structure. Confirm they are completely optimized.
- Write the Input file for the QST2 to the following format:

```
%mem=5GB
%nproc=12
%chk=e3_03.chk
# opt=qst2 freq apfd/6-311+g(2d,p) int=(ultrafine,acc2e=12)

reactant SiH2 +H2 -> SiH4 TS

0 1
SiH2 and H2 Geometry

product SiH2 +H2 -> SiH4 TS

0 1
SiH4 Geometry


 

```
