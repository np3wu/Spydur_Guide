# Sending Your First Gaussian Job
{: .fs-9 }

Here you can follow the directions to send your first Gaussian job on the SPYDUR cluster.

We will start off with completing example 2.1 in the book "Exploring Chemistry with Electronic Structure Methods" by James B. Foresman and Ã†leen Frisch (p. 36). This example is supposed to help you with using the Gaussview interface, however, we will not be following the exact directions in the book. This section will walk you through the steps to complete this example on the SPYDUR cluster.
